# Kent or Beck
Have you ever noticed that the song titles by swedish alt-rock band are similar to the titles of swedish movie series Beck? 

This is a quiz designed to test if you can differ a song title from a movie title. The aim for the website is to provide simple entertainment for beck-lovers, kent-lovers or just regular swedish people between their 20s and 30s.
